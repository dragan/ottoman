== Ottoman

Ottoman is intended to be an easy to use open source library for Mono/.NET applications 
using CouchDB for persistence.  Please excuse the mess, this is a new project and we are 
trying to get everything in order.  We will be setting up a project site, forum, and issue 
tracker.  This will be an active open source project and backed by a company.  We have big 
plans for this library.

A little disclaimer:

Ottoman at it's current state is pre-alpha software and still under heavy development. 
Please be aware that important areas such as the public API may see backwards 
incompatible changes between versions.
